# react static website of www.craftz.dog

> A static website starter kit powered by [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
> and [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).

This project is a fork of old [kriasoft/react-static-boilerplate](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-static-boilerplate) but is updated its dependencies to the latest version.
It also includes some improvements such as Twitter Card and Open Graph support.
Feel free to fork me to bootstrap your website!

## Features
